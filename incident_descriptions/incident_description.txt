Hello! My EC2 instance in AWS is taking a very long time to respond to HTTP requests. Sometimes it doesn't respond at all. I recently changed a security group with new rules for ingress. When I trace the route to the host on the internet I can only reach it from certain IP ranges and not all of them. What is the likely cause, is it the CPU, the storage, the RAM, or the network that is the root cause of the problem?
=======
just created an ec2 instance and can ssh into it and everything but when i go to either its elastic ip or its public DNS url I cannot it returns a page saying Oops! Google Chrome could not connect to 23.23.205.241 I can also ping its public DNS but when i visit that url i also get a Oops! Google Chrome could not connect to ec2-23-23-205-241.compute-1.amazonaws.com message

I can successfully ping the ip address and get a response and i have the following security groups set up: 22 tcp 0.0.0.0/0
25 tcp 0.0.0.0/0
80 tcp 0.0.0.0/0
110 tcp 0.0.0.0/0
143 tcp 0.0.0.0/0
443 tcp 0.0.0.0/0
3306 tcp 0.0.0.0/0
8080 tcp 0.0.0.0/0
0-65535 udp 0.0.0.0/0
53 udp 0.0.0.0/0
-1 icmp 0.0.0.0/0

This instance is of type: Amazon Linux AMI 2012.09 64 bit.

I have just installed tomcat7 on it as well but i was unable to see my webpage before that installation.

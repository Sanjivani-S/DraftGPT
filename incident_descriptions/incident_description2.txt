I am trying to run EC2 instance on AWS but after creating when I do ssh from gibash or any thing else it says time out.
First I think it was some error through my end but it wasn't disabled the firewall etc.
But when I open the public ip address after giving the permission to 80 port from all ip address the webpage open and says it took too much time to respond.
So I clicked on my created instance and pressed Connect from the header and tried to connect direct from AWS (to open console) but the error is still displaying.
I tried with different Operating Systems:
Amazon Linux
Ubuntu
Centos 7
